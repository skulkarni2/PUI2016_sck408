# Assignment 3: Practice formulating the null hypothesis:


### 1)  - Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Significance Level - 0.05 or 5%

**Null Hypothesis:** The mean of weight loss by the people in test group who followed diet is less than or equal to the mean of weight loss by the people in the control group who did exercise 

**Null Hypothesis: H0 = Mean(weight loss)diet <= Mean(weight loss)exercise**

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The mean of weight loss by the people in test group who followed diet is more than the mean of weight loss by the people in the control group who did exercise

**Alternative Hypothesis: Ha = Mean(weight loss)diet > Mean(weight loss)exercise**


### 2) - Do American trust the president?

POLL RESULTS: On May 16, 1994, Newsweek reported the results of a public opinion poll that asked: “From everything you know about Bill Clinton, does he have the honesty and integrity you expect in a president?” (p. 23).Poll surveyed 518 adults and 233, or 0.45 of them answered yes.

Significance Level - 0.05 or 5%

**Null Hypothesis:** The proportion of adult americans who find the President trustworthy is more than the proporton of adult americans who find the President untrustworthy. 

**Null Hypothesis: P0 - P1 > 0  or P0 > P1**

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The proportion of adult americans who find the President trustworthy is less than or equal to the proportion of adult americans who find the President untrustworthy.

**Alternative Hypothesis: P0 - P1 <= 0  or  P0 <= P1**


### 3) - Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking. 

Experimental setup: measure cessation rates for smokers randomly assigned to use a nicotine patch versus a placebo patch.

Significance Level - 0.05 or 5%

**Null Hypothesis:** The cessation rates for smokers using the nicotine patches is less than or equal to the cessation rates for smokers using the placebo patch.

**Null Hypothesis  H0 = (Cessation rate)nicotine <= (Cessation rate)placebo**

**Alternative Hypothesis:** The cessation rates for smokers using the nicotine patches is more than the cessation rates for the smokers using the placebo patch.

**Alternative Hypothesis H1 = (Cessation rate)nicotine > (Cessation rate)placebo**


### 4) - Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women. 

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Significance Level - 0.05 or 5%

**Null Hypothesis:** The mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother smoked during pregnancy is greater than the mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy.

**Null Hypothesis H0:  Mean(IQ at ages 1,2,3 and 4)Smoked > Mean(IQ at ages 1,2,3 and 4)NotSmoked**

**Alternate Hypothesis:** The mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother smoked during pregnancy is greater than the mean IQ of children at ages 1,2,3 and 4 whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy.

**Alternative Hypothesis Ha:  Mean(IQ at ages 1,2,3 and 4)smoked <= Mean(IQ at ages 1,2,3 and 4)NotSmoked**
