## Review

The first impression about this plot is amazing! It is interactive, has a lot of informations to show us and it's very easy and intuitive to use. Studying Dr. Bianco's lecture, I found some points I want to expose about this plot.

Good points:
- Lot of information but well structured and shown
- Colors help to instantly see the difference/magnitude of difference between each month and year
- Very rich database
- Intuitive and exciting. It make you play for a while during the plot exploration.

Attention points:
- The information provided while hovering is the year and ratio, but I think it would be interesting if you show absolute numbers as well (unemployed people and total population). The ratio can be clarifiying at some moments, but it can be tricky in some situations, for example, two months of different years can have the same ratio, but totally different absolute values.
- The colors choosen by this plot is not friendly to a speciffically kind of color blindness, the **Protanopia â€“ Red-Green Color Blindness**. Here is a print of how a person with this type of color blindness can see your plot, you can notice that the dark green and dark red are almost the same.

**General comment:** the plot is amazing! It is intuitive and very informative. Like all good things, we want more, so I think absolute values for each year and each month on hover would be a great improovement. And as an attention point, it is not friendly to color blindness Protanopia people.
Congratulations, very good job!
