# Homeowrk 7

### For this assignment I tried the 'Bokeh' package. 

The plot is a _interactive heatmap_ showing the unemployment rate in US from 1948-2013. 

The plot shows the two recessions and the rate of unemloyment during the those times by hovering the cursor on the dark red colour.
The interactive map could be viewed on [viewer]
(http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/skulkarni2/PUI2016_sck408/blob/master/HW7_sck408/HW7_sck408.ipynb)  and the plot is

### Dependency:

As the plot is created using Bokeh package, to view the plot one has to install the package. 

[Bokeh Installation](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html)

### Note:
Install the package and then run the ipython notebook and the interactive plot would show up. 

Please let me know if there are any questions.
