## Assignment 1:
## a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
**Hypothesis :**Trip duration of people who are in the age (20-40) is longer than those in the age (40-60)
The proposal doesnt clearly states the null hypothesis so I take the above statement and assume a null hypothesis to be - Trip duration of people between (20-40) is less than that of (40-60).
It would have been better to explicitly state both the hypotheses and then carry out tests to reject the null hypothesis. 

## b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)
The data has been properly extracted to fit the analysis as per the hypothesis. It could have been better if the bins selected were smaller (may be 10 years). Also the current selection of age group is could also be seen as younger riders versus order riders. 
Further the data has been normalised and plotted giving a better understanding of the data. Also they have calculated the error and ploted it giving a clear idea of the hypothesis. 

## c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.
According to the hypothesis question trip duration is the continuous dependent variable on age group (dichotomous variable taking two types of values). The dataset is divided into two distinct groups -
1. Riders between 20-40 age group
2. Riders between 40-60 age group
Thus t-test is suitable for this proposal which tests the difference between two groups. 
The correlation test could also be suitable as it has similar parameters as t-test. This test would show the direction (+/-) of the relation between independent and dependent variable. 
Note: If the bin size is reduced and the data is divided into more groups then ANOVA test would be suitable for testing the hypothesis.
