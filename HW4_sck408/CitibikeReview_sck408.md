## Assignment 1:
## a. verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly
**Hypothesis :**Trip duration of people who are in the age (20,40] is longer than those in the age (40,60]



## b. verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test was not chosen yet)


## c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.
