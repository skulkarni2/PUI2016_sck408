# Homework 10 Spatial Data Analysis

I worked alone for this assignment. 

I just followed the lab by Dr. Sina to complete the assignment. 

Note: 
The Moran scatterplots are small for some odd reason in the github version. Please download the notebook and run all the cells and it would show at the desired size.
